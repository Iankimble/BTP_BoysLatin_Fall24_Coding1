6. Which operator would work best for the following function: 
An age verification function that needs to check if a user is a certain age and older to purchase a video game. Please write your answer as a string.

7. Which operator would work best for the following function: 
An office security function that needs to have a specific alpha-numeric code to be entered in order to enter and exit a building. Please write your answer as a string.

8. You have been hired by Github to help them fix their password system. They would like you to create A
   function that will check how long a password is. Your program should be able to accept a alpha-numeric password
   and check if the password is more or less than 10 characters long. if the password is longer than 10 characters,
   your program should tell the user that their password is too long. If the password is under 4 characters the
   function should tell the user the password is too short. If the password meets the length criteria, there should
   be a message confirming to the user that their password was created successfully.

HINT - you will need to use a function that counts the number of characters in a string. I recommend looking this up on W3schools.

9. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a federal income tax function for a tax agency. They would like to be able
to take in a user's annual income ammount and check how much money a person will need to pay in taxes based on the amount passed into the function.

Provided are income amounts and how much they will be taxed:

- If a user makes between 0.00 and 12000.00 per year, they will be taxed 10%, plus an additional 3% for the state.

- If a user makes between 12001.00 and 50000.00 per year, they will be taxed 12%, plus an additional 3% for the state.

- If a user makes between 50001.00 and 103000.00, they will be taxed 22%, plus and additional 3% for the state.

- If a user makes between 103001.00 and 198000.00, they will be taxed 23%, plus and additional 3% for the state. 

Your function should return how much money the person owes in taxes based on the amount of money they provided. 

10. You have applied to several colleges in the state of PA and as your final project, you must create a function
   that will inform you on whether you will be admitted into the school based on the schools' reccomendation letter
   criteria. Your function should take in the name of the school along with whether it is TRUE or FALSE that you recieved 
   a reccomendation letter from one of the staff members at Boys Latin.

Provided are the schools you've applied to and their reccomendation letter criteria.

- Temple Univesity - So long as you have 1 reccomendation letter from BL, you will get in.
- Penn State - You must have 2 letters of recomendation from BL to get in.  
- University of Pennsylvania - You must have 2 letter from BL to get in.
- Cheyney University - You must have 1 letter of reccomendation from BL to get in.

Provided are the letters of reccomendations you've recieved:

- Both Mr. Parker and Mr. Kimble have given you a reccomendation letter to Cheyney University.
- Mr. Kimble has given you a letter of reccomendation for Penn State, but Mr. Parker and Mr. Paris have not.
- Mr. Paris has given you a letter of reccomendation to Temple University, but Mr. Parker and Mr. Kimble have not.
- Mr. Parker has given you a letter of reccomnedation to The University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Kimble did not give you letter of reccomendation, But Mr. Paris did.

Your function should return which schools you did or did not get into based on the information above.
