// Async Activity January 10th, 2025.

// 1. Create 3 different lists data types that will include things found in grocery store. Make sure your items use the string data type.
// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the frozen food isle.
// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the international food isle.
// Creat a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the produce isle.

// A list is a data type that can be used to group and collect other
// data types together in one variable.

// list can contain all data types, including variables and other lists.

var internationalFood = [
  "Ramen",
  "Chili sauce",
  "Soy sauce",
  "Old bay",
  "Tacos shells",
];
var produceFood = [
  "apples",
  "bell peppers",
  "mushrooms",
  "tomatos",
  "cucumbers",
];

groceryShoppingList = [internationalFood, produceFood];
console.log(groceryShoppingList);

// 2. With the list provided below; use the print (for python) or
//  console.log (for javascript) functions to return the correct 
// value for the index.
var numbers = [1, 30, 39, 50, 293, 100];
// Hint: If you get stuck, search for accessing JS list by index or accessing Python list by index depending on which language you are learning
// print/ console.log the number at index 0
1;
// print/ console.log the number at index 3
50;
// print/ console.log the number at index 4
293;

// 3. Create a function that will multiply the number at index 4 in the 
// list above.

function multiplier(x) {
  // console.log(x * 293);
  // console.log(x * numbers[4]);
}
