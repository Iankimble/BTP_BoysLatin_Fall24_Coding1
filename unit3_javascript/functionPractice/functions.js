// What is function?
'A function is a set instructions that performs a specific task'
'or job.'

// Functions come in 2 variations:
// built-in functions- These are instructions that are pre-written
// into the coding language, All we need to do is pass in data. 

// examples
var className= 'Coding class'
console.log(className)
 
// user-defined functions- These are custom instructions written by
// engineers to make code that performs specific tasks. 

// How do we write a user-defined function?
function exampleFunction(){
    console.log('The function script is connected.')
}

// in order to have a function work, we need to call it. 
// the above code is the function definition- MEANING- it's only
// telling the computer the instructions- NOT to actually run it. 

// we access or call a function by writing its name.
exampleFunction()
