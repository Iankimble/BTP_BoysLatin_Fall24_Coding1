## Async Activity December 6th, 2024 ##
Inside of your unit 3 folder create a new file called 
asyncActivityDec6.py OR asyncActivityDec6.js, depending on which programming language you are learning. 

Please follow the directions provided and answer the following questions.This will be do at the end of class. This will need to be submitted whether you are present or not. 

The questions are code agnostic, meaning it does not matter which
coding language you are learning- you should be able to answer them 
regardless of if you are learning JavaScript or Python.

Good luck.

1. Create a function that will accept a word in the function parameter
and return the word in reverse order.
For example, the word 'pet' should return as 'tep', the word 'book'
should return as 'koob', etc.
HINT- There is a built-in function that you can use to accomplish this. 
Please use W3 schools to research what function you'll need to use.

2. Create a function that uses a conditional statement to output a block
of text that will tell users about a states landmarks.
Your program should return the following states and their respective
landmarks. For example, if a user passes in the value of south carolina,
in the function parameter, your program should return the message:
' A landmark in South Carolina is Fort Sumter, where the inital shots of the'
'American Civil war took place.' WRITE A COMPLETE SENTENCE!

Pennsylvania = Liberty Bell.
New York = Statue of Liberty.
California = Hollywood Walk of Fame.
One additional state and landmark of your choice.

If you pass in a state that does not exist in your program,
your function should return a message saying that the state
could not be found.

HINT: refer back to your notes and use w3schools to reseach if/else conditional statements.
