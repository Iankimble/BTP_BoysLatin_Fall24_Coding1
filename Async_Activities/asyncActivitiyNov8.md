## Async Activity November 8th, 2024 ##
inside of your unit 3 folder create a new file called 
asyncActivityNov8.py OR asyncActivityNov8.js, depending on which programming language you are learning. 

Please follow the directions provided and answer the following questions.This will be do at the end of class. This will need to be submitted whether you are present or not. 

Good luck.

1. What does it "string concatenation" mean? Please write your response as a string and also provide a code example of two variables being concatenated and output the result in your terminal. 

- if you are learning JavaScript you will be using the 
console.log() function.

- if you are learning Pyhon you will be using the print() function.

2. Please list and describe three rules for creating variable names. Please provide your answer as a string.

3. Define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them.
- Camel case
- Snake case
- Pascal case

4. Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operaor code snippets

***Python Version***
a = '?'
b = a *100
print(b) // the output in the terminal should be 300. 

***JavaScript Version***
let a = '?'
let b = a *b
print(b) // the output in the terminal should be 700. 


5. Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables
to get the requested result.

***Python Version***
- which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions are **true**. use the print function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.

x= 10
y= 2
z= y*2

x > 1 _____ z==4 

***JavaScript Version***
- which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions below are **false**. Use the console.log() function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.

var x= 12
var y= 2
var z= 12/4

x <= 12 _____ z < 10
