# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR GAME APP
# You are working on a game concept with several 
# other engineers and you need to provide them with a
#  simple proof of concepts. 
# For now, you have suggested that your 
# game work on a RPS (rock, paper, scissors) loop. 
# When a user plays, rock, paper, or scissors, 
# the computer will randomly select one of the 3 
# options as well. Your program will then determine 
# who won, based on the values. The game should only 
# allow the player to play 3 hands, and inform the 
# player if the won or lost (best 2 out of 3 format.)
