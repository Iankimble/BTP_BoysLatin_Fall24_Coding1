8. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a sales tax function for the state of Pennsylvania. They would like to be able to take in a annual ammount of money businesses in the state make and deduct the proper amount of taxes from the their earnings. The state of PA should take 7% of a companies earnings. 
Your function should take in a total sales amount as an argument and return the amount thats owed to the state. 

Provided is an example of what your program should do:
- If Ian's Development and Design company made $200,000.00, the state should deduct 7% from that total. 
- Ian's Development and Design company should pay $14,000.00 in sales tax. 

9. You have been hired by Apple to help them fix their password system. They would   like you to create A
function that will check how long a password is. Your program should be able to accept an integer password
and also check if the password is more or less than 10 characters long. if the password is longer than 10 characters,
your program should tell the user that their password is too long. If the password is under 4 characters the
function should tell the user the password is too short. If the password meets the length criteria, there should
be a message confirming to the user that their password was created successfully.

HINT - you will need to use a function that counts the number of characters in a string. I recommend looking this up on W3schools.

10.  You have applied to several colleges in the state of PA and as your final project, you must create a function
   that will inform you on whether you will be admitted into the school based on the schools' reccomendation letter
   criteria. Your function should take in the name of the school along with whether it is TRUE or FALSE that you recieved 
   a reccomendation letter from one of the staff members at Boys Latin.

Provided are the schools you've applied to and their reccomendation letter criteria.

- Temple Univesity - So long as you have 1 reccomendation letter from BL, you will get in.
- Penn State - You must have 2 letters of recomendation from BL to get in.  
- University of Pennsylvania - You must have 2 letter from BL to get in.
- Cheyney University - You must have 1 letter of reccomendation from BL to get in.

Provided are the letters of reccomendations you've recieved:

- Both Mr. Parker and Mr. Kimble have given you a reccomendation letter to Cheyney University.
- Mr. Kimble has given you a letter of reccomendation for Penn State, but Mr. Parker and Mr. Paris have not.
- Mr. Paris has given you a letter of reccomendation to Temple University, but Mr. Parker and Mr. Kimble have not.
- Mr. Parker has given you a letter of reccomnedation to The University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Kimble did not give you letter of reccomendation, But Mr. Paris did.

Your function should return which schools you did or did not get into based on the information above.
